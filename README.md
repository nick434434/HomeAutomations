# HomeAutomations

This is a repo containing some current and future useful scripts which can be used for running at home to deal with certain problems or make some routine tasks simple

The goal of this is to make a good-looking collection of code chunks which may be helpful in day-to-day life while keeping the codebase well-maintained and adhering to the Python clean code standards as much as possible

## Plans

There are no definitive plans as for developing new automations, however, there are some "organisational" ones:

- add pre-hook(s)
- add linter(s)
- add formatter(s)
- (?) add poetry
