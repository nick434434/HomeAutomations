# HomeAutomations

This is a repo for some current and future useful scripts for running at home to deal with certain problems or make some routine tasks simple

The goal of this is to make a good-looking collection of code which may be helpful in day-to-day life while keeping the code well-maintained and adhering to the Python clean code standards as much as possible

## Plans

There are no definitive plans as for developing new automations, however, there are some "organisational" ones:

- add pre-hook(s)
- add linter(s)
- add formatter(s)
- (?) add poetry
